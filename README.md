Flask Application Deployment Pipeline
This project demonstrates how to build and automate the deployment of a Flask-based web application using Docker, Nginx, GitHub Actions, and shell scripting. It includes a full CI/CD pipeline setup with scripts for building, testing, deploying, and rolling back the application in case of failure.

Technologies Used
Flask (Python Web Framework)

Docker and Docker Compose

Nginx (Reverse Proxy and SSL Termination)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD Workflow Automation)

Shell Scripting

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deployment-pipeline.git
cd deployment-pipeline
2. Build the Docker Image
bash
Copy
Edit
bash scripts/build.sh
3. Run Tests
bash
Copy
Edit
bash scripts/test.sh
4. Deploy Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up --build
Once it’s running, you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost.

How the CI/CD Pipeline Works
The GitHub Actions workflow (deploy.yml) is triggered whenever you push code to the main branch.

It performs the following steps:

Check out the code

Install dependencies

Run the test suite

Build the Docker image

Optionally push the image to a registry

Deploy the application using the deployment script

If something fails, the rollback script is triggered

This ensures the application is tested, built, and deployed automatically with minimal human intervention.

Nginx and SSL Setup
Nginx is configured to serve as a reverse proxy in front of the Flask application. It handles:

Routing requests to the app

Serving static files (if needed)

SSL termination using certificates located in the ssl/ folder

You can either use self-signed certificates for testing or integrate Let's Encrypt for production.

Rollback Support
If a deployment fails (due to a test failure, build issue, or runtime error), the rollback.sh script will automatically:

Stop the current broken container

Start the previous working version

Restore application availability

Configuration for Different Environments
Environment-specific settings like database URLs, debug mode, secret keys, and logging levels are defined in:

config/development.py

config/staging.py

config/production.py

You can switch between environments by setting the appropriate environment variable when running the app.
